<p align="center"><strong>Creating and manipulating binary trees</strong></p>

<p align="justify">A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. These children themselves are binary trees, making it a recursive data structure. Binary trees are employed in various applications, including database indexing, expression parsing, and organizing hierarchical data like file systems and folder structures.</p>

## ✅ Project Requirements
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All our files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Our code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl ](https://github.com/hs-hq/Betty/blob/main/betty-style.pl)and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/hs-hq/Betty/blob/main/betty-doc.pl)
- We are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- We are allowed to use the standard library
- All our header files should be include guarded
